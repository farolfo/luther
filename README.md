# Luther - Donate Bitcoin Now

Luther is an open source non-profit project that looks for helping people donating money to verified charity entities and NGOs (Non Gubernamental Organizations) using Bitcoin.

Luther provides the BTC addresses of these organizations, with the link of their site in case the user wants to validate the address, which its always encouraged.
