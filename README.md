# Luther - Donate Bitcoin

Luther is an open source non-profit project that looks for helping people donating BTC to verified charity entities and NGOs (Non Gubernamental Organizations).

Luther provides the BTC addresses of these organizations, with the link of their site in case the user wants to validate the address.

The verification process of the NGOs is made via Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, similar of how Spotify verifies their artists accounts.

### Compile

Luther's base code is tested under node ```v6.11.13```. If you don't have node installed yet, doing it via ```[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)``` is highly recommended.

Then, run

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

```
