# Luther - Donate Bitcoin Now

Luther is an open source non-profit project that looks for helping people donating money to verified charity entities and NGOs (Non Gubernamental Organizations) through Bitcoin.

Luther provides the BTC addresses of these organizations, with the link of their site in case the user wants to validate the address (which we always ENCOURAGE).


### Compile

Luther's base code is tested under node ```v6.11.13```. If you don't have node installed yet, doing it via ```[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)``` is highly recommended.

You MUST have already installed localy ```grunt``` and ```babel```.

```
npm install grunt-cli
npm install babel-cli@6 babel-preset-react-app@3
```

Then, run

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

Start a local web server using grunt (with an npm command) and go to http://localhost:9000.
